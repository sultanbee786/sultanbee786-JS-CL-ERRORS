    <h1>Errors in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Even though JavaScript tends to be much more loose with errors compared to other languages due to its loose typing 
        feature, there are still cases where errors must be thrown - such as a issue with HTTP (such as a timeout or a CORS
        issue), or, in this case, calling a non-existent function.

        When the button below is clicked, you should use Javascript's error handling to cause an alert on the page.
    </p>
    <button id = "errorButton">This button will trigger an error.</button>
    <br>
    <button id = "noErrorButton">This button will not trigger an error.</button>
    <p id = "monitor"></p>
    <script src = "Lab.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
